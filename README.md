## Objectives
- Load and inspect the dataset.
- Handle missing values and clean the dataset.
- Explore data distributions and relationships.
- Visualize trends and patterns using plots.
- Summarize insights from the EDA process.

---

## Tools & Libraries
The following Python libraries were primarily used:

- `pandas` – Data manipulation and cleaning
- `numpy` – Numerical operations
- `matplotlib` – Data visualization
- `seaborn` – Advanced statistical plots

---

## Key Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading & Inspection**
   - Loaded dataset using `pandas`.
   - Checked for data types, null values, and summary statistics.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values.
   - Converted categorical variables into appropriate formats.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed variable distributions.
   - Investigated correlations and relationships.
   - Created plots like histograms, bar charts, and heatmaps for insights.

4. **Insights & Patterns**
   - Identified trends in the dataset.
   - Highlighted key relationships between features.
